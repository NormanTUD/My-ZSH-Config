# My-ZSH-Config
This is the collection of config files needed for my configuration of my ZSH. I did not write most of these myself, but copied them from any number of sources as seemed fit, though, because it was ever only intended for presonal use, I never documented these sources.

## Installation

Install the powerline-fonts (on Debian, sudo apt install fonts-powerline, see https://github.com/powerline/fonts for other systems).

Copy these files to ~/.oh-my-zsh, ~/.zshrc and ~/.zsh respectively.
